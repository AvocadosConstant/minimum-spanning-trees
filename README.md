# Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm Analysis
###### CS 375 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) Final Project

***
### Problem to solve: 
Given a connected undirected graph, what is its minimum spanning tree?

### Algorithms to implement:  
Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. Possibly Bor≈Øvka's algorithm and the reverse-delete algorithm time permitted.

### Questions to investigate:
Which algorithms are most efficient when? Do some perform better or worse depending on factors such as: Number of vertices, number of edges, maximum and minimum degree, planarity, simple graphs vs multi graphs, other graph invariants, etc.

### Implementation:
We will implement the algorithms and run them on a variety of different graphs with different properties. We will log each algorithms efficiency, effectiveness, and correctness and compare them to each other.
